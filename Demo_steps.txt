1. Log in: Face recognition.
	1.1 Try stranger log in.
	1.2 Try team member log in.
	1.3 Illustrate implementation

2. API functionality
	2.1 Music
		play music (by song/artist/album)
	2.2 Book flight
		book a ticket (using conversation)
	2.3 Weather
		ask for weather
	2.4 IOT
		turn on/off the light

3. Context continuation
	3.1 Context Reload
		3.1.1 Log in user1 and ask some questions.
	    	3.1.2 Log off and log in another user2 and ask some other questions.
		3.1.3 Log off and log in user1 again
to reload the conversation context.
		3.1.4 Ask some question to show the context loaded.
	3.2 Context switch
	    shared param(music.album, music.artist, flight.to<=shared by weather and flight booking)

4. Further improvement
	4.1 More flexible context switching
	    Write a matching algorithm so that without a manual configuration, the program intelligently associate a parameter with another in another context, i.e. destination in flight booking is the address of hotel booking, and check weather and traffic status for the time of booking to inform the user.
	4.2 More involvement of IOT devices
	    Including air con, automatic curtains, heating, water boiler, etc.
	4.3 Customization
	    Be able to remember preference for each user in terms of IOT and music and other functionalities so that instead of repeatedly asking questions, pull up data from the DB to achieve intelligence.
