1. Frontend
	Demonstrated by Zen
2. Log in: Face recognition.
	2.1 Try team member log in (and show confidence).
	2.2 Illustrate implementation

3. API functionality
	3.1 Music
		play music (by song/artist/album)
		Play song: Play let it go.
		Play album: let's hear eat a peach
		Play artist: Get eminem/I want to hear Taylor Swift
	3.2 Book flight (skip)
		book a ticket (using conversation)
		Input:
			From: Sydney
			To: Shanghai
			Date: TMR
	3.3 Weather 
		ask for weather
		Input:
			Place: Melbourne	
			Date: next week
	3.4 IOT
		turn on/off the light
		Input: Light up the place. + Shut the light.


4. Context continuation
	4.1 Context Reload
		3.1.1 Log in user1 and ask some questions.
			Input: I want to book a flight from Brisbane to Beijing on 22/05/2019.
	    	3.1.2 Log off and log in another user2 and ask some other questions.
			Input: I want to book a flight from Sydney to Perth on today.
		3.1.3 Log off and log in user1 again to reload the conversation context.
		3.1.4 Ask some question to show the context loaded.
			Input: What is the weather then? (address==from(Brisbane) & date==(22/05/2019) => No need to input address and date)
	4.2 Context switch
	    shared param(music.album, music.artist, music.song, flight.to<->weather.address+flight.departure<->weather.date-time)

	    Input: Get me Bruno Mars (Artist given) => Play album + Play song

	    Input: Book a flight from Cairns to Darwin today => Get weather

	    Input: What's the weather in Sydney today => Book a flight from Shenzhen
 
5. Further improvement
	5.1 More flexible context switching
	    Write a matching algorithm so that without a manual configuration, the program intelligently associate a parameter with another in another context, i.e. destination in flight booking is the address of hotel booking, and check weather and traffic status for the time of booking to inform the user.
	5.2 More involvement of IOT devices
	    Including air con, automatic curtains, heating, water boiler, etc.
	5.3 Customization
	    Be able to remember preference for each user in terms of IOT and music and other functionalities so that instead of repeatedly asking questions, pull up data from the DB to achieve intelligence.
